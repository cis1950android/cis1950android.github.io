Throughout my time at Penn, I have often found immense support in the CIS TA staffâ€”whether in coursework help, career advice, or simply someone to talk to. However, as a CIS and Econ double major I never found the time to TA a course myself. Thus, for my last semester here at Penn, one of my goals is reciprocate the support I have gratefully received during my past four years. In CIS 1950, I am excited to combine my passions in Android development and helping and teaching others, all towards the aspiration of giving back to the CIS community.
