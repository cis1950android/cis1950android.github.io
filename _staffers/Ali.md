## Why teaching?
Teaching to me is a form of art. I worked as a Teaching Assistant in CIS2400 for three semesters, and it has been undoubtedly the highlight of my time at Penn. The single most satisfying experience is to leave a positive mark in someone's life, to make them enjoy what they learn, to build a human connection and defuse their anxieties. A teacher is a psychologist, an expert, an influencer - in the original sense of the word prior to social media - a friend, a mentor, and a role model. Reading this, you probably thought of your favorite teacher, and similarly you can think of that one teacher that made you hate their subject in a blink. The mark is there. Nothing is as meaningful as easing a learner's worry while simultaneously optimizing their journey. It is an act of service and giving; and it is always an honor to give.
