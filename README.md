# **CIS1950 - Android Development in Kotlin**

## <span style="color:grey"> Spring 2023 with Ali Krema </span>

Android applications are everywhere, but what are they made of and how do they work? Well, let's build some to find out! In this project-oriented course, you'll learn the skills and techniques needed to build multi-page, feature-rich apps for Android in Kotlin.

Through exploring the very basics all the way through layout design and user interface development to app architecture and connectivity, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of the Android ecosystem and all that it has to offer. Whether you are a beginner or had some previous experience in Android (or never even had an Android device yourself), this course has something to offer for everyone.

## Course Policies

### Attendance

Attendance is your way to excel in the class. Going to class and giving full attention will save you hours of work on homework assignments and projects. Coming to class also enhances the learning experience of other students, as well as your instructor. You get **2 unexecused absences** that will not affect your grades, but you must inform the staff on Ed beforehand. TL;DR: Just come to class, and you get 2 free misses.

### Late Submissions

The late submissions policy is very lenient, but it assumes you know how to manage your schedule. Here's the deal: you can request up to **72-hour** extensions for all homework assignemnts. However, you need to request it on Ed beforehand. Extensions beyond 72 hours will generally be avoided unless there is a major exception, in which case you should email Ali at krema@seas.upenn.edu

For the final project, we will keep the deadline firm for now and assume no extensions will be needed given the generous time window available to work on the project. Adjustments will be made as needed throughout the semester.

### Collaboration

Homework assignments are to be completed **individually**. No code should ever be shared/copied among students, but you are free to discuss high-level ideas and request group office hours as well. The class is very hands-on and it is designed so that you can learn without ever needing to cheat. You can have our word for it. You have plenty of office hours, unlimited resources online that you can consult without directly copying code.
