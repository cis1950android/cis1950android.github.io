# **Final Project**

It is finally time. This is your chance to shine and crown your efforts throughout the semester into one final Android application. This project makes up for 30% of your final project.

## **Project Structure**

- You will be working on this project in **groups of 2-3 people**, exceptions will be made for those who prefer to work alone. However, it is highly encouraged to get the experience of working with others. If you don't have a group in mind, there is a form below for you to fill and your instructor will match you in a group (recommendation only, you still have to finalize the matching) based on preferences and self-evaluations.

- Your group will be presented with **three categories/app ideas** to pursue for the final project, in addition to a **fourth open category** if you have a different app idea in mind. If you choose the open category, you will have to **confirm your idea with Ali** before you work on it.

- You will get approximately 4 weeks to finish your project, following the timeline below

## **Project Timeline**

* Project Writeup Release **(Saturday March 25th)**
* [If you don't have a group set] Fill out the [group formation survey](https://forms.gle/YTNG57UHH4FU9y7HA) by **Monday 3/27 11:59pm**
* Submit your group information to your instructor by **Wedensday 3/29 11:59pm** (instructions below)

* Receive further instructions and expectations of your chosen category on **Friday March 31st**
* Milestone 1 [In-class] - on **Thursday 4/13**, we will check all groups' progress and have peer-reviews among groups working on different categories. More details on that a week before.
* Final Demo - meet up with your instructor on **Thursday 4/27** and demo your work! 

## **Project Categories**

As a group, choose one of the following categories to work on for your project:

1. **Movies App** → display a live list of movies that are currently in theatre through the movies API
2. **Dining Halls** → display a list of Penn dining halls with details on click through the Penn Labs API, just like in Penn Mobile
3. **Tic Tac Toe** → create the game Tic Tac Toe, including 1P mode with "AI", and 2P mode to play with a friend
4. **Open Category** → come up with your own idea and confirm it with your instructor

The descriptions above are abstracted and high-level. Once your group chooses a category, you will recieve further information and instructions regarding your app requirements.

## **Group Formation**

If you have a group, skip step 1
1. fill out the [group formation survey](https://forms.gle/YTNG57UHH4FU9y7HA) by **Monday 3/27 11:59pm**. After recieving an email with a proposed matching from your instructor, proceed to step 2
2. if you are satisfied with the matching from the form (or if you already have a group finalized) send the following information to `krema@seas.upenn.edu` by **Wednesday 3/29 11:59pm**
    * Each Group member's name and email address
    * Group Name (pick something quirky)
    * Category chosen (if you choose the open category, include a description of your idea)
