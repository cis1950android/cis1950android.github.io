# **Homework 0: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Kotlin!**

## **Introduction**

In this homework, you will familiarize yourself with Kotlin & Android Studio basics through implementing the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors!

But don't worry, you're not starting from scratch. Instead, you will be starting with this [starter code](https://www.upenn.edu/) and go through a bunch of steps marked by the keyword _TODO_, in which you will be either completing missing code or writing functions.

You can go through the _TODO_ steps in any order you prefer. However, it is **very highly recommended to go through them in the numerical order provided**. This will make your coding journey more coherent and enjoyable.

In addition, you should complete them in order so that you can benefit from the _checkpoint_ steps in between the _TODOS_, which will guide you on what to expect the app to look like as you go, and encourage you to run it and test the so-far implemented features.

## **Game Overview**

The game you are making is a Rock, Paper, Scissors! 2-player game. Each player selects one option of the three and submits it. Then, the other player gets their turn and submits. The game either ends with one player winning or a draw.

## **Setup**

Download the [starter code](https://www.upenn.edu/), extract it, and open the project from Android Studio.

## **Instructions**

All the instructions you need are in `MainActivity.kt`, and it is the only file in which you will be writing code. Go over the file and familiarize yourself with the variables, functions, and enum classes. The TODO items will then give you everything you need!

## **Extra Credit**

In `TODO: (10)`, you are asked to write a toast message to be displayed when the user attempts to confirm their move without actually making a move.

Your extra credit task is to be as quirky, funny, and/or creative as you can. During the lecture following the HW due date, there will be anonymous voting on the toast messages among students. The owner whose toast message wins the vote gets a 2% extra credit.

## **Submission**

Export the project into a .zip file and submit to [gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/480677)
